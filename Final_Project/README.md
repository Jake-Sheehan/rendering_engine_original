## How do I approach designing software?

I try to take a modular approach to software design by encapsulating reusable
code in namespaces and classes.

## How do I approach developing programs?

I use an iterative approach to software development by adding features one at a time.
Then, I test the new feature, refactor the code, and incorporate it into the main branch.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Moving forward, I plan to continnue development on this project to create a 2D game engine.
